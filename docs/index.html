	<h1>UseBB 1 <em>Readme</em></h1>
	<div id="content">
		<p>Welcome to the UseBB 1 introduction document. This file gives some general information regarding UseBB, how to install/upgrade, etc.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#install-usebb">Install UseBB 1</a></li>
			<li><a href="#upgrade-usebb">Upgrade an existing UseBB</a></li>
			<li><a href="#more-info">More information</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2 id="install-usebb">Install UseBB 1</h2>
		<p>Before you install UseBB 1, you have to make sure your host accords to the following system requirements.</p>
		<h3>Minimum requirements</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>HTTP server supporting PHP (or CGI)</li>
			<li>PHP version 4.3.0, including <code>session</code>, <code>PCRE</code> and <code>mysql</code> extensions</li>
			<li>MySQL version 3.23</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Recommended set-up</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>GNU/Linux operating system</li>
			<li>Recent Apache HTTPD version, including <code>mod_rewrite</code></li>
			<li>Recent PHP 5 version, including <code>session</code>, <code>PCRE</code>, <code>mysql(i)</code>, <code>zlib</code> and <code>curl</code> extensions</li>
			<li>Recent MySQL version</li>
		</ul>
		<p>UseBB 1 supports PHP 5 upto the recent versions of 5.4, and was tested with MySQL versions up to MySQL 5.5.</p>
		<p>UseBB was also confirmed to work with some other HTTP servers, such as Microsoft IIS, lighttpd and ABYSS. However, there is no guarantee the latest version still does.</p>
				
		<p class="important"><strong>Important:</strong> If you use <strong>MySQL 4.1 or higher</strong>, it is highly recommended to use a <strong><code>latin1</code> collation</strong> instead of a Unicode one. Should your host use Unicode as default database collation, please change this for your database using phpMyAdmin or a similar administration tool or contact your host <em>before</em> installing UseBB 1. In most cases though, no action will be necessary.</p>

		<p>To install UseBB 1, you have two options.</p>
		<p class="important"><strong>Note:</strong> You must choose <strong>only one</strong> of the following installation methods. You don't have to follow both lists of steps. If you don't know what to choose, perform the automatic installation.</p>
		
		<h3>Automatic installation</h3>
		<p>The <strong>automatic installer</strong> is mostly the best and easiest method to install UseBB 1.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Rename <code>config.php-dist</code> to <code>config.php</code>;</li>
			<li>Upload/move all the files to their final destination online;</li>
			<li><em>Optional:</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod">chmod</a> <code>config.php</code> so that it is writable by the webserver, this will able both the installer and UseBB's ACP to change settings;</li>
			<li>Open the <a href="../install/index.php">installation wizard</a> in your web browser (located at <code>install/</code> &ndash; the previous link only works when reading this file after uploading).</li>
			<li>Follow the instructions in the wizard.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Manual installation</h3>
		<p>Alternatively, you can install UseBB 1 manually.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Execute <code>install/schemas/mysql.sql</code> followed by <code>install/usebb.sql</code> on your database (using a database management tool such as <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/">phpMyAdmin</a>);</li>
			<li>Rename <code>config.php-dist</code> to <code>config.php</code>;</li>
			<li>Edit <code>config.php</code> and adjust the database settings<sup>1</sup>;</li>
			<li>Upload/move all the files except for the <code>install</code> directory to their final destination online;</li>
			<li><em>Optional:</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod">chmod</a> <code>config.php</code> so that it is writable by the webserver, this will able UseBB's ACP to change settings;</li>
			<li>Register a first user, it will automatically be an administrator.</li>
		</ol>

		<p><sup>1</sup>Use type '<code>mysqli</code>' if you use PHP 5 and have the <code>mysqli</code> extension available.</p>

		<h3>After installation</h3>

		<p>When installation is done, you can log in and start configuring your forum. The link to the ACP (Admin Control Panel) is at the bottom of the page.</p>
		<p>If this is a public forum, it is advised to <a href="anti-spam.html">read the <strong>anti-spam</strong> instructions</a> and take appropriate measures. By default no anti-spam features are enabled.</p>
		
		<h2 id="upgrade-usebb">Upgrade an existing UseBB</h2>
		<p>If you run a forum powered by a previous UseBB 1.0 version, you can upgrade as following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Recommended: make a <strong>backup</strong> of the database before continuing.</li>
			<li>
				Perform changes (note this only works for updating the previous release):
				<ul>
					<li>Reupload all changed files. There is a separate package only containing new and changed files.</li>
					<li><strong>Or</strong> apply the patch found in the separate download file <code>usebb-&lt;version&gt;.diff</code>. The patch can be applied using <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/patch/">GNU patch</a> or a compatible tool.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Alternatively, you can also reupload all files (except <code>config.php</code>).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Separate download files can be found at <a href="http://www.usebb.net/downloads/">www.usebb.net/downloads</a>.</p>
		<p>Upgrading from several (now really old) 0.x versions is not possible without making database changes. Ask for help at <a href="http://www.usebb.net/community/">the forums</a>.</p>
		
		<h2 id="more-info">More information</h2>
		
		<h3>Important note</h3>
		<p>While there are <strong>Unicode</strong> patches applied to the source, Unicode remains officially unsupported in UseBB 1. Please use Unicode (UTF-8) based translations at your own risk.</p>

		<h3>Developer's remark</h3>
		<p>UseBB 1 and its beta versions 0.x were developed as a hobby project, partially to gain experience with PHP and web development. The first code was written in 2004.</p>
		<p>Even though UseBB 1 has proven to be very suitable for small communities and is still maintained, its implementation should not be seen as a good example of the usage of modern (web) development techniques. For example, UseBB 1 lacks good use of object oriented programming and contains a number of design flaws that should be avoided in other (web) applications.</p>
		<p>Consider UseBB 1 for what it is: a light and &ndash; most important &ndash; classic bulletin board system.</p>
